                    <h3>Sergeant Douglas</h3>
                    <h4>A Life Forged in War</h4>
                    
                    <p>There are many noble boys, born under great Lords and Knights, who are taught from a young age the values of chivalry. These boys grow to become men of honour, riding forth to spread justice and defend the innocent in the name of their king and country.</p>

                    <p>Sergeant Douglas is not one of these men.</p>

                    <p>Born in York in the year of our Lord 1330, Douglas's father was a man of moderate talent, a ministerial from Scandinavia who had settled in the bustling English city. His mother, however, possessed a sharp wit and a keen understanding of trade and other practical skills, which she diligently sought to impart to her children.</p>

                    <p>As the third child, Douglas inherited little in the way of land or fortune. His early prospects seemed bleak, and despite attempts to secure work as an entertainer, his distinct lack of musical skill meant he often struggled for a meager meal or two.</p>

                    <p>Luckily for Douglas, a great war was brewing.</p>

                    <p>In 1343, as tensions escalated across the Channel, Douglas found himself drawn into the burgeoning conflicts. He quickly learned basic martial skills, and his natural, if rough-hewn, charisma proved surprisingly effective in securing him work protecting vulnerable trade routes. For the next decade, he honed his martial prowess, not in the tourney grounds of chivalry, but in the brutal crucible of necessity. He also acquired a dark practical education, learning how to "persuade" a man who stole valuable goods, how to assess the worth of a human life for ransom, and how much a human life was worth when extinguished.</p>

                    <p>By 1349, with the Black Death ravaging England, Douglas made his way from London, crossing the narrow sea to Normandy. There, amidst the chaos of the Anglo-French conflicts, he found a new purpose, helping to rally and train local militia, turning peasants into serviceable, if raw, fighting men.</p>

                    <p>In 1351, his reputation, however unsavory, attracted the attention of a formidable trading company, journeying from the heart of the Holy Roman Empire. This company, keen to exploit the prevailing discord, offered goods and services to the highest bidder. It was during this time that Douglas encountered Sir Nicholas Hale, a knight of some repute, who, recognizing Douglas's raw talent and ruthless efficacy, offered to train him further in the sophisticated art of the sword in exchange for his unique, pragmatic skills.</p>

                    <p>Douglas remained deeply embedded in the swirling conflicts of the Hundred Years' War. He became a more efficient killer, a master of inflicting pain upon others, and his burgeoning ability to train others in the brutal dance of war made him an increasingly valuable asset.</p>

                    <p>By 1357, his reputation had reached the ears of the Duke of Gascony, a staunch English ally. Douglas was formally hired to take a more loyal stance on the side of the English Crown. He proved an invaluable tool in the myriad skirmishes and larger engagements that arose, not only for his prowess in battle but also for his exceptional skill at training other soldiers, transforming raw recruits into effective fighting units.</p>

                    <p>After three years of loyal service to the Duke, Douglas was contacted by Sir William, a trusted retainer of Lord Terrance. He was offered board and food in exchange for continuing to train soldiers and helping to "keep the peace" within Lord Terrance's domains.</p>

                    <p>It was Lord Terrance who, recognizing Douglas's ruthless effectiveness in maintaining order, formally anointed him with the rank of Sergeant. Sergeant Douglas, in turn, kept the town under a tight, unyielding control, ensuring continued support for the English war effort through means both fair and foul.</p>

                    <p>Later, Sergeant Douglas would be placed under the banner of Sir Michael, a testament, perhaps, to his practical "good deeds" in securing English interests.</p>

                    <p>You will find Sergeant Douglas still patrolling the dusty streets of a frontier town, or perhaps the sprawling camp of an expeditionary force. He will gladly show you the way of the sword, if you dare to ask him. Or he may just as easily place you in chains for a minor transgression. With Sergeant Douglas, who knows what will happen? His path is as unpredictable as the war that shaped him.</p>
