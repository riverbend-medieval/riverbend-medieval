            <h2>Detailed Narrative</h2>
            
            <h4>The Scottish Connection</h4>
            <p>In 1306, during the First War of Scottish Independence, Maggie was six years old and had been recently fostered to the Bruce's Clan. Her Laird, Sir Alexander de Meyners, was fighting with The Bruce to restore independence to Scotland. When King Edward I of England kidnapped The Bruce's womenfolk, Maggie was abducted along with them and taken as hostage to St Chad's in Rochdale, Lancashire, where Richard de Perebald was vicar.</p>

            <h4>Life at St Chad's</h4>
            <p>Maggie was put to work as a maid in the household. She grew up in the vicarage under the tutelage of Richard de Perebald, a beautiful place with many families connected to the vicarage. When Thomas de Boulton became the Vicar in 1317, he gave Maggie permission to marry and even provided a dowry so she could marry well.</p>

            <h4>The Family Grows</h4>
            <p>Maggie had known the son of the church gardener since her arrival in 1306, and they had grown up together, spending much of their free time adventuring in the local woods. Their relationship evolved from childish friendship to mature affection, and they married in the summer of 1318, when Maggie turned 18 years old. Elenor and Meg are two of their children.</p>

            <h4>Scottish Heritage</h4>
            <p>After the Scottish war of independence, Maggie was able to re-establish connection with her Scottish family, the de Meyners. She has been blessed to be accepted into the clan, even though she married an Englishman and her children are English. In 1336, for her 30th birthday, Sir Robert de Meyner and his heir, John, sent her the clan tartan so her children would learn of their Scottish heritage - the ancient hunting tartan in beautiful reds and greens.</p>

            <h4>Life at St Chad's</h4>
            <p>The family has remained the keeper of the church gardens at St Chad's, receiving many advantages because of their position. Although just servants, they have been allowed access to the same foods as the vicarage and their children have been schooled along with the vicar's own children. The sons and husband maintain the church woodland, providing rabbits, pheasants, and occasional deer for their table.</p>

            <h4>Daily Life</h4>
            <p>Maggie's daughters and she maintain the vegetable and herb garden, help with making soaps and salves, spinning, weaving and dyeing fibres. The Vicar's wife is very kind to them, often providing beautiful cloths, ribbons, and other small wares from her own surplus. Their home is much superior to many other servants in England, with separate structures for the animals, a wooden floor on the lower level, two bedrooms above, and even the old curtains and tablecloth from the vicarage.</p>
