                    <h1>Stephanus' Lesson on Making Medieval Ale</h1>
                    <p>Welcome to my personal guide on brewing medieval ale! This page shares my experience in recreating authentic medieval brewing practices, based on historical research and practical experimentation.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The History of Medieval Ale</h2>
                    <p>In medieval times, ale was more than just a beverage - it was a staple of daily life. Unlike modern beer, medieval ale was typically brewed without hops (which were introduced later) and was often flavored with a variety of herbs and spices known as "gruit." The brewing process was significantly different from modern methods, particularly in that the wort was not boiled after mashing, which resulted in a more nutritious but less stable beverage.</p>

                    <h2>My Preferred Recipe</h2>
                    <p>After numerous experiments and variations, here's my preferred recipe for making medieval-style ale:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>3kg Pale Malt</li>
                        <li>500g Roasted Barley</li>
                        <li>1kg Rolled Oats</li>
                        <li>1 packet US-05 Ale Yeast (Nottingham is better but harder to source)</li>
                        <li>About 50g of herbs for flavoring (I've used dried Yarrow, but Rosemary works too - use less Rosemary!)</li>
                        <li>11L of spring water</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>The Brewing Process</h2>
                    <h3>Step 1: Heating the Water</h3>
                    <p>Heat the water in a large pot. For authentic medieval methodology, watch the bottom of the pot - once small bubbles begin to break away from the bottom, the water is at the right temperature. For modern methodology, aim for about 67 degrees Celsius.</p>

                    <h3>Step 2: Mashing</h3>
                    <p>Mix the grain with the herbs in your mash vessel. While a large European Oak tub with a bung or tap would be ideal, a modern esky (cooler) works well for practicality. I use a grain bag to make removing the dredge easier, but in period equipment, you'd use a second European Oak bucket to collect the strained mash liquor for fermentation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Pour the hot water, one ladleful at a time, over the dredge from about waist height (this step can be skipped if using modern temperature measurement). Stir the mash with a mash fork or large spoon. Cover it loosely with a cloth while it mashes (or shut the esky lid), and leave it for 60 to 90 minutes.</p>

                    <h3>Step 3: Straining and Fermentation</h3>
                    <p>Strain the fresh wort off of the mashed dredge into your fermentation bucket (or lift the grain bag out of the esky, letting it drip drain). If you live somewhere appropriately cool, you can leave it covered until it comes down to ambient temperature (aiming for just over 20 degrees C). Otherwise, use an ice bath to help cool it. Once it's at temperature, add the packet of yeast.</p>

                    <h2>Yeast Options</h2>
                    <p>While US-05 Ale Yeast works well, I've found that Nottingham yeast produces better results, though it can be harder to source. For an even more authentic experience, I've experimented with 'farmhouse ale' yeast mixes and lambic yeast mixes, though these can be more expensive and harder to find than Nottingham.</p>
