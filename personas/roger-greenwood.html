            <h3>Detailed Narrative</h3>
            
            <p>Born on the 19th of November, 1330, in the Hundred of Macclesfield, Roger Greenwood's life began in the shadow of the Macclesfield Forest, near the flowing waters of the River Goyt. As the son of a Husbandman farmer who tended to 80 acres of land, young Roger learned the value of hard work and precision from an early age.</p>

            <p>His natural talent with the longbow soon became apparent, and when the call to arms came from King Edward III, Roger answered without hesitation. His skill with the bow would serve him well in the coming years, particularly at the Battle of Crécy on the 26th of August, 1346, where he fought as an archer in the English ranks.</p>

            <p>It was in the aftermath of battle, in the city of Rouen, that Roger's life took a turn for the better. There, he met and fell in love with the widow Lady Cristine, who was sheltering with friends. Their love story culminated in a beautiful ceremony at the abbey of Saint-Ouen in October 1348, beginning a partnership that would last through decades of warfare and adventure.</p>

            <p>Roger's military career took him through the most significant conflicts of the age. He fought with the Free Companies throughout Normandy, Gascony, and Aquitaine until 1355, when Edward III renewed the war with France. His skill and leadership were recognized when he was promoted to the rank of Ventenar after the grande chevauchée of 1355, a position he would hold with distinction.</p>

            <p>The years that followed saw Roger fighting in some of the most significant battles of the Hundred Years' War. He stood with Edward of Woodstock at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356, and later joined the legendary White Company of John Hawkwood, fighting throughout Italy until 1367. During these years, he and Lady Cristine were blessed with three sons, all of whom would follow in their father's footsteps as men-at-arms in service to the English crown.</p>

            <p>Roger's later years saw him fighting at the Battle of Nájera in 1367 and the Siege of Limoges in 1370. After the death of Edward of Woodstock in 1376, he returned to the Free Companies, continuing to fight throughout France and Gascony.</p>

            <p>In 1380, Roger and Lady Cristine finally returned to England, where he joined the Riverbend Medieval Society as their Ventenar. Today, he leads the Archers as a Free Company on campaign in Europe, bringing his wealth of experience and leadership to bear in training the next generation of English archers.</p>

            <p>Roger Greenwood's life is a testament to the skill and dedication of the English yeoman archer. From the fields of Macclesfield to the battlefields of France and Italy, his story weaves through the tapestry of medieval warfare, leaving an indelible mark on the history of the age.</p>
